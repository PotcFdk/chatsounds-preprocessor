This is probably the ugliest C++ code I've ever written.  
It generates lists for a specific Garry's Mod addon.  
That's about it.  

If you're lucky, you might get it to compile.
You need to link some boost libraries and libbass.

On most modern GNU/Linux systems, installing boost, running the included `setup.sh` and then running `make` should get it to build.
Feel free to [create a GitHub issue](https://github.com/PotcFdk/chatsounds-preprocessor/issues) if it doesn't compile.
