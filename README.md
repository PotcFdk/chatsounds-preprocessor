=======================

This is probably the ugliest C++ code I've ever written.  
It generates lists for a specific Garry's Mod addon.  
That's about it.  

If you're lucky, you might get it to compile.
You need to link some boost libraries and libbass.

On most modern systems, installing boost, running the included `setup.sh` and then running `make` should get it to build.
Feel free to [create a GitHub issue](https://github.com/PotcFdk/chatsounds-preprocessor/issues) if it doesn't compile.
